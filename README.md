# Weather-App
In this project, I created an React and Redux application that allows a user to search for weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API in a similar fashion to the following screenshot. It has five quick-links buttons for cities you always check on weather updates, It also has a search-bar for any city in the world that gives you real world weather updates.

## Setup

Set env variable as REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY

Run npm start
